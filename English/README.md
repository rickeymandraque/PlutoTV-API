**Welcome to the PlutoTV API Reverse Engineering Exploration repository!**

This repository aims to provide unofficial documentation and tools to understand and explore the PlutoTV API. The goal is to comprehend the underlying structure of the API so that developers can create their own applications, scripts, and tools to interact with PlutoTV's content.

## Repository Contents

- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation on using the PlutoTV API.
- **Usage:** Information on how to use the provided scripts in the repository.
- **Error Codes:** Explanations of possible error codes and their meanings.
- **Script Examples:** Examples of primarily Bash scripts to interact with the PlutoTV API.
- **Parameters:** A comprehensive list of parameters supported by the API.
- **Domain List:** Information about the domains used by the API.
- **Information:** Other relevant information about the API and its operation.

## Introduction

The PlutoTV API Reverse Engineering Exploration repository is dedicated to exploring the API endpoints, parameters, and data structures used by the PlutoTV platform.

PlutoTV is a popular streaming service that offers a wide range of content, including live TV channels and on-demand shows.

This repository serves as a resource for developers interested in understanding how to access and use PlutoTV's content programmatically.

This repository was created to provide unofficial documentation for the PlutoTV API, an online content streaming platform.

The objective is to offer a deeper understanding of the API, especially for creating custom scripts and playlists for live streams and video on demand (VOD).

The inspiration for this project came from a Python script found in the repository [Lunatixz/KODI_Addons](https://github.com/Lunatixz/KODI_Addons) and the desire to develop similar scripts using Bash commands.

This repository is dedicated to the reverse engineering of the PlutoTV API.

I created this unofficial documentation because information about the PlutoTV API is hard to find online.

It all began with a simple Python script that I found [here](https://github.com/Lunatixz/KODI_Addons/blob/master/plugin.video.plutotv/resources/lib/plutotv.py), which sparked my interest in creating my own Bash script to generate custom playlists for live streams and video on demand (VOD).

While there are many playlists and scripts for live streams, reliable options for VOD seem to be lacking.

With the help of ChatGPT and my terminal, I realized that some of the necessary information for the API was missing from the sources I consulted.

I also noticed that the PlutoTV platform collects a considerable amount of information, which aligns with their business model but can be quite concerning in certain cases.

This repository will also contain Bash scripts to facilitate the use of the API.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to fill the gap in official documentation for the PlutoTV API.

While there are some scripts and tools available for interacting with PlutoTV's content, a comprehensive and accurate source of information about the API's endpoints and parameters is often missing.

This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing clear documentation, examples, and explanations for the PlutoTV API.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `documentation`: Contains detailed explanations of API endpoints, query parameters, and their meanings.
- `scripts`: Includes example scripts written in various programming languages (primarily Bash and Python) to interact with the PlutoTV API.
- `english`: Contains documentation and files in English.
- `francais`: Contains documentation and files in French.

## Documentation

The `documentation` directory contains detailed explanations of the various API endpoints, query parameters, and their intended use.

It includes information on how to construct API requests, interpret responses, and make the most of the available data. The documentation is available in both English and French.

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to interact with the PlutoTV API.

These scripts are written in various programming languages (primarily Bash) and showcase different uses, such as fetching live channel data, retrieving on-demand content, and generating playlists.

These scripts can serve as a starting point for your own projects that utilize PlutoTV's content.
